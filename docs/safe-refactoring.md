## 1. Safe Refactoring Steps

1. **Create a Branch:** Start by creating a new branch for your changes.
2. **Understand Dependencies:** Use the directory index and README.md files to identify related modules and dependencies.
3. **Update References:** When renaming or moving files, update all imports and references.
4. **Write/Update Tests:** Ensure existing tests pass and add new tests for refactored code.
5. **Run Lint & Format:** Use ESLint and formatting tools to maintain code style.
6. **Document Changes:** Update relevant documentation (README.md, architecture docs) to reflect changes.
7. **Code Review:** Submit a pull request for review before merging.

## 2. Adding New Features

- **Modular Structure:** Add new features in `src/features/` or the most appropriate domain folder.
- **Register Components:** Add new UI components to `components/` or `widgets/` as needed.
- **Update State:** Add new stores or actions in `stores/` if state management is required.
- **Document Feature:** Add or update documentation for the new feature.
