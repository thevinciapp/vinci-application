# Shared

The `shared` directory contains reusable code and resources that are used across multiple parts of the application. This includes utilities, types, constants, configuration, and shared UI elements.

Contents may include:
- `api/`: Shared API helpers.
- `components/`: Shared UI components.
- `config/`: Shared configuration files.
- `constants/`: Application-wide constants.
- `hooks/`: Shared React hooks.
- `types/`: TypeScript types used throughout the app.
- `ui/`: Shared UI primitives.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.

This folder is intended to reduce duplication and centralize code that is not specific to a single feature or domain.
