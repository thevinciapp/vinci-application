# Components

The `components` directory contains atomic or small reusable UI components. These components are typically presentational, focused on a single responsibility, and are used as building blocks throughout the application's UI.

Examples:
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: Error boundary component for catching UI errors.
- `command-center/`: Group of related, small components for the command center feature.

Components in this folder are distinguished from widgets by their simplicity and reusability at a low level. For larger, composite UI elements, see the `widgets/` directory.
