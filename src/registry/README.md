# Registry

The `registry` directory contains registries and catalog files for dynamically loaded resources within the application, such as dialogs and providers.

- `dialogs.tsx`: Registry for dialog components.
- `providers.tsx`: Registry for provider components or services.

This folder is intended for files that manage or expose collections of components, services, or other resources that are registered and accessed dynamically at runtime.
