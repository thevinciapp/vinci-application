# Widgets

The `widgets` directory contains larger, composite UI elements that are built from smaller components. Widgets typically encapsulate complex functionality or group related components into a single, reusable unit.

Examples:
- `chat-panel/`: Composite UI for chat functionality.
- `dialogs/`: Group of dialog-related components.

Widgets are distinguished from atomic components by their complexity and their role as higher-level building blocks in the application's UI.
