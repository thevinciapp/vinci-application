# Guideline: Use TypeScript for all code
# Reason: TypeScript provides type safety, clarity, and maintainability

# Guideline: Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features and syntax
# Reason: Modern syntax improves readability, safety, and developer experience

# Guideline: Use Bun as the package manager and script runner
# Reason: Bun is fast, modern, and supports advanced workflows

# Guideline: Use Vite for builds and development
# Reason: Vite provides fast, efficient, and modern build tooling

# Guideline: Use React for all UI code
# Reason: React is the industry standard for composable, maintainable UIs

# Guideline: Use functional components and hooks in React
# Reason: Functional components and hooks are more predictable and easier to test

# Guideline: Use strict linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
# Reason: Consistent code style is essential for a world-class codebase

# Guideline: Use absolute imports from the project root
# Reason: Absolute imports improve clarity and reduce import errors

# Guideline: Use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components/classes, camelCase for variables/functions
# Reason: Consistent naming conventions make code easy to navigate

# Guideline: Organize code by feature/domain, not by type
# Reason: Feature-based structure improves modularity and scalability

# Guideline: Keep functions and files small and focused
# Reason: Small, focused code is easier to test, maintain, and reason about

# Guideline: Handle errors explicitly and gracefully
# Reason: Robust error handling prevents bugs and improves user experience

# Guideline: Never add comments to the code
# Reason: Comments are not needed in modern code

# Guideline: Remove all comments from the code
# Reason: Comments are not needed in modern code

# Guideline: Never use the "any" type in TypeScript code
# Reason: "any" type is not type-safe and should be avoided

# Guideline: Never use the "unknown" type in TypeScript code
# Reason: "unknown" type is not type-safe and should be avoided

# Guideline: Always commit the current state before making changes
# Reason: This ensures all changes are traceable and recoverable

# Guideline: Every change must be recorded in the project changelog
# Reason: The changelog provides a clear history of all modifications

# Guideline: All changes must be tested and verified to work
# Reason: This ensures the codebase remains stable and reliable

# Guideline: All changes must be well documented in external documentation files
# Reason: Documentation outside the code improves clarity and maintainability

# Guideline: Always research and understand the codebase before making changes
# Reason: Research prevents mistakes and ensures high-quality contributions

# Guideline: Strive for code that is elegant, clear, and a joy to read
# Reason: World-class code attracts top talent and accelerates innovation

# Guideline: Review every change as if you were onboarding a new world-class engineer
# Reason: High standards ensure the codebase remains exceptional and future-proof
